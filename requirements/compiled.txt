# These requirements are not included in the bundled ``vendor/`` lib, and must
# be installed on target machines via system package managers (or pip).

# Installing from source via pip requires gcc. In addition, lxml will require
# libxml2-dev and libxslt1-dev; MySQL-python will require libmysqlclient-dev,
# and pyOpenSSL will require libssl-dev (package names may vary on a
# non-Debian-based system).
